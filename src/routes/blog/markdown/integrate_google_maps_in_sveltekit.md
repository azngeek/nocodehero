# How to integrate Google Maps into SvelteKit

Most applications these days make use of some sort of mapping functionality. When it comes to web applications, the Google Maps API is one of the most popular choices. In this blog post, I'll show you how to integrate the Google Maps API into a SvelteKit application. While the process is fairly straightforward, there are a few things to keep in mind that we'll go over. So let's get started!

1. What is SvelteKit and why you would want to use it
2. How to get started with the Google Maps API
3. How to integrate the Google Maps API into SvelteKit
4. What are some benefits of using the Google Maps API in SvelteKit

## What is SvelteKit and why you would want to use it
SvelteKit is becoming an increasingly popular Javascript framework in the web development world! It offers easy integration and a low learning curve when compared to popular alternatives like Vue.js and React. This makes it a great option for developers of any skill level who need to integrate Google Maps API - or any other external service - into their project. Moreover, with its easy-to-grip syntax, SvelteKit allows developers to quickly start creating their application's business logic and integrating APIs with little overhead time. For all these reasons, SvelteKit has become a very attractive choice for many developers looking to use external services in their applications.

## How to get started with the Google Maps API
If you're looking to get started with the Google Maps API, there are a few steps you'll need to take. First of all, you'll need an API key, which can be acquired through the official Google Developer Console. After that's done, it's time to start integrating the Google Maps API in your SvelteKit project by installing an appropriate dev dependency and adding any required imports. Of course, more advanced usage may require samples or tutorials that guide you through creating interactive map components. With some research and some example code, you should be able to get up and running with the Google Maps API in no time!

## How to integrate the Google Maps API into SvelteKit
Developers using the Google Maps API have found it to be a relatively straightforward and intuitive experience. The API allows developers to quickly integrate mapping functionality into their applications without having to write from scratch or grapple with complex code. With its easy-to-grip syntax, SvelteKit makes the entire process of integration seamless, allowing developers to

```ts
<script lang="ts">
	import { onMount } from 'svelte';
	import { Loader } from '@googlemaps/js-api-loader';

	onMount(() => {
		let map: google.maps.Map;

		const loader = new Loader({
			apiKey: 'AIzaSyDTmK_YB6FWixG9BczztAcaV6WtNZgVatY',
			version: 'weekly'
		});

		var grayStyles = [
			{
				featureType: 'all',
				stylers: [{ saturation: -20 }, { lightness: 30 }]
			}
		];

		loader.load().then(() => {
			const loc = { lat: 47.7063905, lng: 11.8763645 };

			map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map') as HTMLElement, {
				center: loc,
				zoom: 12,
				styles: grayStyles
			});

			const image =
				'./wedding-couple.png';
			const beachMarker = new google.maps.Marker({
				position: loc,
				map,
				icon: image
			});
		});
	});
</script>
```

## What are some benefits of using the Google Maps API in SvelteKit
Using the Google Maps API in SvelteKit provides a multitude of benefits! Streamlining your frontend development process is made easier with the API's integration with SvelteKit, making coding faster and more efficient. Plus, using the API gives developers easy access to real-time data regarding locations, routes, and routes â€“ making sure that client applications remain up-to-date and properly informed. Additionally, incorporating the Google Maps API into SvelteKit helps create progressive web applications with reliable performance and faster loading times.



## Conclusion
Google Maps API can be easily integrated into SvelteKit. This allows for many benefits, such as a faster development process and the ability to use all of the features of the Google Maps API. If you have any difficulties implementing this integration, let me know and I'll be happy to help.
